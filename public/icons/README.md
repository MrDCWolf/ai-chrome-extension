# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16)
- icon48.png (48x48)
- icon128.png (128x128)

You can use any image editor to create these icons. For testing, you can download placeholder icons from:
https://www.google.com/chrome/static/images/chrome-logo.svg

Save the image in the required sizes with the correct filenames.
